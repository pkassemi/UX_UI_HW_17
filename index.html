      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> As I was working through my Master's Thesis in Linguistics, I had this idea of an app called Connect with Zaban, which would bring language speakers together in an effort to encourage language acquisition. I ended up doing my entire thesis on the value of this app, and as I was writing my thesis, I was exposed to the field of UX.

        Making the decision to change career paths into UX was a very easy one. I have never been so passionate about an industry. I remember driving down the freeway one day, paying attention to the road signs and I realized, as much as we don't think about it, good design is extremely important. In fact, it could be the difference between life or death. If a designer makes a mistake in the way a road sign is designed, it could cause many problems in society and could be detrimental to the user. My passion is to design amazing interfaces for my user that are both effective and aesthetically pleasing.
        
        My goal is to continue to grow creatively into a position of leadership within the field of UX. I hope to continue contributing my ideas and unique experiences to collaborate with clients and help design pleasing digital products.
